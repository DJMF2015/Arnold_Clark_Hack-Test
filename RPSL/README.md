<h2>Browser-based 'rock, paper, scissors, Lizard, Spock' game</h2>

## The Task
We need you to develop a Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game.
What the trek?! Don’t worry, it’s an expansion on the classic, made popular by
The Big Bang Theory, just a few additional rules;

- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock
- Rock crushes Lizard
- Lizard poisons Spock
- Spock smashes Scissors
- Scissors decapitates Lizard
- Lizard eats Paper
- Paper disproves Spock
-Spock vaporizes Rock (and as it always has)
- Rock crushes Scissors

The program should take a player gesture as input, and using random behaviour
generate a counter gesture, and calculate the winner. Easy! Or is it??

### Rules
- There are no rules.
- Use any programming language you like, or even one you dislike. If you’re not confident with a programming
