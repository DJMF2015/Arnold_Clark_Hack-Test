## Arnold Clark Hack Day Test
#### The task

##### We need you to develop a Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game.
What the trek?! Don’t worry, it’s an expansion on the classic, made popular by
The Big Bang Theory, just a few additional rules;

* Scissors cuts Paper
* Paper covers Rock
* Rock crushes Lizard
* Lizard poisons Spock
* Spock smashes Scissors
* Scissors decapitates Lizard
* Lizard eats Paper
* Paper disproves Spock
* Spock vaporizes Rock
(and as it always has...)
* Rock crushes Scissors


NOTE: The first to score a total of 5 points (computer or player) is the overall winner of the game

<h5> The program should take a player gesture as input, and using random behaviour generate a counter gesture, and calculate the winner. Easy! Or is it??</h5> Rules: There are no rules.

<h6>Use any programming language you like, or even one you dislike. If you’re not
confident with a programming language, send us the algorithm you’d use to do
this written in pseudo code.</h6>
